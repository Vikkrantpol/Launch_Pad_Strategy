# Launch Pad Trading Strategy Backtest

This repository demonstrates a proprietary trading strategy backtest implemented in Python, applied to daily DOGE (Dogecoin) price data. The strategy employs technical indicators to generate trading signals and manages positions to maintain a single trade (long or short) at a time. The specific trading logic is proprietary and has been masked to protect intellectual property. This project serves to showcase my expertise in quantitative finance, data analysis, and visualization.
